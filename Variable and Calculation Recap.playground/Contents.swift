//Variable and calculation

var str = "Hello Absolute Beginner Christophe"

var age = 51
print(age)

let favoriteNumber = 22
print(favoriteNumber)

//Age is subject to change as we grow older so it is not a constant. The favorite number is a constant as it will always be 22 in the cae of Mr Absolute Beginner.

//calculation

// Try doing some calculations with variables using the + plus, - minus, / divide , *multiply operators, += add 1 to the variable, -= take 1 off the variable, () brackets to calculate one part of equation before anotherâ€¦ assign the result to a variable called result, then print result to the screen 

var result = (age) + (favoriteNumber)
print (result)


// I bring here the age and favorite number directly in the equation. I could have written var = 51 + 22 but i wanted to give clarity and also I wanted to see how it works diffently.

var result1 = (age) - (favoriteNumber)
print (result1)

// Here i gave result a new name, result1 as the variable cannot have the same name. It always must be different. I will go on by giving name result2 and result 3.

var result2 = (age) * (favoriteNumber)
print (result2)

// It is also important to indent your code PROPERLY so that it is readable for everyone.!!!

var result3 = (age) / (favoriteNumber)
print (result3)

// * is Multiply, - is minus, + is plus, / is divide

var result4 = ((age) + (favoriteNumber)) + ((result3) - (result2))
print (result4)

// I played around to see what is happening with the value and also to see with different way of creating an Calculation.

var result5 = 51 + 22
print (result5)

//Now i see i can put the numbers as well. It is another form, it might serve depending on What is being created as an App.

var result6 = (22 / 2) * ( 51 / 2)
print (result6)

//Any complicated or complex, complex is better, complicated refers to personal complicated mind, Complex is more accurate for coding.
