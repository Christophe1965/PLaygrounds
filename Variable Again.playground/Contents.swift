import UIKit

var str = "Hello Absolute Beginner Christophe"

// String is "Chaine" in French. 

// this is a variable

var word: String = "Hello Absolute Beginner Christophe"

// (remember = is assign) the sign = means to ASSIGN.

// a CONSTANT cannot be changed. The information here cannot be changed and you want it that way. It is something that will be used in the program and repeated maybe so you do not want to have to write again and again.

let name = "Mr Absolute Beginner"
let surname = "Christophe"


//we add an age to that beginner called christophe

var age: Int = 51
print("I am \(name) called \(surname) and I am \(age)")

//The \ is an escape character.
//Variable must be put between the brackets ()

//When I write, I must remember Var for variable, Let is for Constant, the String after Var or Let is the value we give. 
// Explicitely means "clarity", the value given is clear so it is clear as well for the compiler.
// Implicitely means somehow that the compiler will have to figure it out, it might slow down the program.


var number = 22

//Why might a developer prefer to explicitly define a variable (think what is important about a program?)

print("i am \(name) called \(surname) and I am \(age), my favorite number is \(number)")

//Write some comments. Why do we comment code? 
// It is essential to write comments to understand your work better. it is alos important for others to understand your code properly and clearly so that no confusion arises. As a beginner it is a good way to remember everything your learned.
